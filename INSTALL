The portable version of OpenIKED uses the GNU autoconf environment to
build and install from the sources.  As usual, follow these basic
steps to install OpenIKED:

1. Requirements:
    - Make sure that the external libraries OpenSSL (version 1.0 or newer)
and libevent (version 1.4 or newer) with their header files are
installed.
    - If you're checking out the sources from the Git repository, you will
also need GNU automake, autoconf (version 2.69 or newer) and libtool.
2. Enter the top directory of the extracted sources.
3. If you checked out the sources from the Git repository, run
`sh bootstrap` to generate the required build files.
4. Run `./configure` in this directory to generate the Makefiles.
    - `./configure --help` will show you some available build options.
    - For example, you can run the following when building on Apple OS X
with MacPorts:
```
    ./configure --with-ssl-dir=/opt/local/ \
        --with-libevent-dir=/opt/local/lib/libevent1/ \
        --prefix=/opt/local/
```
5. Type `make` to build all parts of OpenIKED including iked and ikectl.
6. Type `make install` to install OpenIKED, or `sudo make install` if
you didn't compile OpenIKED as root.

7. Run something like the following to create iked's unprivileged
system user and environment. Note that the command syntax and user
name might vary on different platforms - use "iked" instead of "_iked"
on Linux.
```
        # mkdir /var/empty
        # chown root:sys /var/empty
        # chmod 755 /var/empty
        # groupadd _iked
        # useradd -g _iked -c 'iked privsep' -d /var/empty -s /sbin/nologin _iked
```

For creating system users on newer versions of Apple OS X, refer to
the `dscl` command line utility, eg.
```
        # dscl . -list /Groups gid | sort -n -k 2
        # dscl . -create /Groups/_iked gid 300
        # dscl . -create /Groups/_iked RealName "OpenIKED"
        # dscl . -create /Groups/_iked passwd "*"
        # dscl . -list /Users UniqueID | sort -n -k 2
        # dscl . -create /Users/_iked
        # dscl . -create /Users/_iked NFSHomeDirectory /var/empty
        # dscl . -create /Users/_iked uid 300
        # dscl . -create /Users/_iked gid 300
        # dscl . -create /Users/_iked UserShell /usr/bin/false
        # dscl . -create /Users/_iked RealName "OpenIKED"
        # dscl . -create /Users/_iked passwd "*"
```

8. On FreeBSD, NetBSD and maybe other BSD-variants IPsec is not
enabled in the default GENERIC kernel.  You have to compile a custom
kernel and enable options like `IPSEC`.  Please refer to the
individual documentation for details, for example:

* http://www.freebsd.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/ipsec.html
* http://www.netbsd.org/docs/network/ipsec/#config_kernel
