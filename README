This version of OpenIKED is derived from the openiked.org version,
which is itself a port of OpenBSD's iked to Darwin/OS X and other
operating systems.  This version has grown features and improvements
not found in the original version.

iked is a lean Internet Key Exchange (IKEv2) daemon which performs
mutual authentication and which establishes and maintains IPsec VPN
flows and security associations (SAs) between the two peers.  The
IKEv2 protocol is defined in RFC 5996, which combines and updates the
previous standards: ISAKMP/Oakley (RFC 2408), IKE (RFC 2409), and the
Internet DOI (RFC 2407).  iked only supports the IKEv2 protocol;
support for ISAKMP/Oakley and IKEv1 is provided by OpenBSD's
isakmpd(8) or other implementations on non-OpenBSD platforms.

iked supports mutual authentication using RSA public keys and X.509
certificates, it also support responder/server-side authentication of
clients using the EAP-MSCHAPv2 protocol over IKEv2.  It interconnects
with other IKEv2 implementations like the native IKEv2 implementation
of Windows 7 or newer (aka Agile VPN) or strongSwan.
